# Local Micro-Events Social Network (Vibe/JoyJoin)

## Overview

JoyJoin (悦聚·Joy) is a social networking platform connecting individuals locally through small, curated micro-events (5-10 attendees). It uses AI for user matching based on interests, personality, and social compatibility, with a focus on psychological safety and inclusivity. Targeted at the Hong Kong/Shenzhen market, the platform aims to foster meaningful local connections and community building. Key features include AI-powered matching for events and people, a comprehensive feedback system for algorithm refinement, streamlined event management, and a robust Admin Portal for platform oversight and analytics.

### Recent Changes (Nov 21, 2025)
- **Admin Login Enhancement - Verification Code Support**: Added dual login method for admin portal
  - **UI Update**: AdminLoginPage now uses Tabs component with "验证码登录" (default) and "密码登录" options
  - **Verification Code Login**: Admins can login using phone number + SMS code (test code: 666666)
  - **Backend Fix**: Modified `/api/auth/phone-login` endpoint to return complete user object including `isAdmin` flag
  - **Admin Validation**: Frontend checks `isAdmin` field after verification code login, shows error if non-admin account
  - **User Experience**: Consistent login experience between user and admin portals, with 60-second countdown on send code button
  - **Test Accounts**: Phone 13800138000 or 19896500978, both support verification code 666666 for testing

### Recent Changes (Nov 20, 2025)
- **Temperature Concept Implementation - Social Energy & Chemistry Visualization**: Added dual-temperature system for richer matching insights
  - **Social Energy Temperature** (社交能量温度): 14 archetypes mapped to 0-100 energy scale (社交蝴蝶=95 high → 独立思考者=25 low)
  - **Energy Balance Algorithm**: `calculateEnergyBalance()` evaluates group social dynamics (ideal avg: 50-70, low stdDev for harmony)
  - **Chemistry Reaction Temperature** (化学反应温度): Visual emoji indicators based on overall match score
    - 🔥 炽热 (Fire, ≥85): Exceptional compatibility
    - 🌡️ 温暖 (Warm, 70-84): Strong compatibility
    - 🌤️ 适宜 (Mild, 55-69): Moderate compatibility
    - ❄️ 冷淡 (Cold, <55): Low compatibility
  - **Updated Scoring Formula**: `overallScore = avgPairScore × 0.6 + groupDiversity × 0.25 + energyBalance × 0.15` (refined from 70/30 to 60/25/15)
  - **UI Integration**: Temperature emoji displayed in WebSocket notifications, AdminMatchingLogsPage, and group explanations
  - **Database Schema**: Added `energyBalance` (integer) and `temperatureLevel` (varchar) to `eventPoolGroups` table
  - **Impact**: Provides intuitive visual feedback on match quality and prevents all-high or all-low energy groups
- **Matching Algorithm Fix - Removed Diversity Double-Counting**: Fixed critical algorithm flaw where diversity was calculated twice
  - **Old Logic (Flawed)**: `calculatePairScore()` included diversity at 10% → `overallScore = avgPairScore × 0.7 + groupDiversity × 0.3` (diversity added again at 30%)
  - **New Logic (Corrected)**: 
    - **Pair Compatibility Score** (配对兼容性): chemistry 37.5% + interest 31.25% + preference 25% + language 18.75% = 100%
    - **Overall Score** (综合分数): Now integrated with energy balance (see Temperature Concept above)
  - **Conceptual Clarity**: Pair compatibility measures similarity (共同兴趣、语言), group diversity measures richness (背景多样性)
  - **Variable Renaming**: `avgChemistry` → `avgPairScore`, `calculateGroupChemistry()` → `calculateGroupPairScore()` for accuracy
  - **Impact**: Algorithm now properly balances finding compatible pairs (60%) with diverse groups (25%) and balanced energy (15%)
- **Real-time Dynamic Matching System Complete**: Fully automated continuous matching with adaptive thresholds
  - **Database Infrastructure**: `matchingThresholds` table for configurable parameters, `poolMatchingLogs` table for decision tracking
  - **Three-Tier Threshold System**: High compatibility (≥85) instant match, medium (70-84) wait for better options, low (55-69) wait until deadline, <55 reject
  - **Time Decay Algorithm**: Thresholds gradually lower as event deadline approaches to ensure successful matching
  - **Matching Triggers**: Instant scan on registration + hourly scheduled scans + 30-min scans in final 24 hours
  - **Backend Service**: `poolRealtimeMatchingService.ts` with intelligent scanning, threshold evaluation, and logging
  - **Admin UI**: `/admin/matching-config` for threshold tuning, `/admin/matching-logs` for decision history visualization
  - **API Integration**: Registration endpoint triggers instant matching check, admin can manually trigger scans
  - **Production Ready**: All parameters database-driven, no code changes needed for tuning based on real user feedback
- **Invitation System Complete**: Full viral growth mechanism implemented
  - Auto-issue ¥50 INVITE_REWARD coupon to inviters when invited users match together
  - Frontend displays invitation badges: "已邀请 [name]" (purple) for inviters, "[name] 邀请的" (blue) for invitees
  - Database: `user_coupons` tracks coupon assignments, `invitation_uses` tracks invitation rewards
- **Event Pool Discovery Fixed**: `/api/event-pools` now correctly displays admin-created blind box events
  - Status unified to `active` (replaces previous `published` and `recruiting`)
  - Database schema synchronized with all required columns (description, eventType, educationLevelRestrictions, etc.)
  - DiscoverPage successfully fetches and displays event pools created in Admin Portal
- **Event Pool User Flow**: Completed user-facing integration of two-stage matching model
  - DiscoverPage fetches real event pools from database via `/api/event-pools`
  - EventPoolRegistrationPage allows users to register with soft preferences (budget, languages, social goals, cuisine, dietary restrictions, taste intensity)
  - BlindBoxEventCard updated to navigate to registration page when clicked
  - EventsPage integrated to display pool registrations alongside traditional events, with status-based filtering (pending/matched/completed)
  - New component: PoolRegistrationCard for displaying pool registration status and match scores
- **WebSocket Real-time Notifications**: Implemented POOL_MATCHED event for instant user notifications
  - poolMatchingService.saveMatchResults() broadcasts POOL_MATCHED event to all matched users via wsService.broadcastToUser()
  - Frontend EventsPage subscribes to POOL_MATCHED events, displays toast notification with pool/group details, invalidates cache, and auto-switches to "已匹配" tab
  - Added PoolMatchedData interface to wsEvents.ts with poolId, poolTitle, groupId, groupNumber, matchScore, memberCount
  - Complete bidirectional WebSocket sync: Admin completes matching → Backend broadcasts → Users receive instant notification
