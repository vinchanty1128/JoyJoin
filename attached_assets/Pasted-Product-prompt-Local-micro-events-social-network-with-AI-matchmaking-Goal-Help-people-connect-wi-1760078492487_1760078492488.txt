Product prompt: Local micro-events social network with AI matchmaking

Goal
- Help people connect with like-minded locals through small, curated events (5–10 attendees) that feel inclusive, safe, and high-quality.
- Maximize attendee satisfaction and sense of belonging via AI-driven event matchmaking.

Core user journeys
1) Onboarding and vibe profiling
- New users complete a concise personality and social-vibe questionnaire (interests, energy level, conversational style, introvert/extrovert spectrum, dietary/drink preferences, budget, schedule, accessibility needs, comfort zones, social goals).
- Allow optional data import (e.g., calendar availability) and opt-in constraints (travel radius, preferred venues).
- Produce a private “Vibe Profile” with tags and embeddings used for matching.

2) AI event matchmaking
- Generate or recommend small-group events (5–10 people) based on:
  - Shared and complementary interests
  - Social vibe compatibility (energy balance, conversational styles)
  - Time/location availability, commute tolerance
  - Diversity of backgrounds while maintaining psychological safety
  - Past feedback, NPS, and satisfaction signals
- Provide transparent reasons for matches (e.g., “Board games + chill vibe + weeknight availability”).
- Support both auto-assigned slots and user opt-in to shortlists.

3) Event discovery and booking
- Show a personalized feed of upcoming events (activities, dinners, drinks, workshops).
- Each event displays: vibe tags, host/guide, venue details, accessibility notes, attendee mix preview, ticket price or “included in subscription”.
- Users can pay per event or subscribe for access to exclusive events and priority matching.
- Confirmations include social norms and code of conduct.

4) Event hosting and facilitation
- Events are organized by the platform with an active guide/host to ensure smooth flow, inclusion, and safety.
- Hosts receive run-of-show, icebreakers, and contingency plans tailored to attendee vibes.
- Post-event: structured feedback from attendees and hosts.

5) Feedback loop and continuous learning
- Collect quick post-event ratings on enjoyment, match quality, vibe fit, willingness to see group again.
- Update user embeddings and matching weights; avoid repeat mismatches; surface promising re-groupings.

Key features and requirements
- Matching engine
  - Inputs: user embeddings from questionnaire + behavior signals (RSVPs, attendance, dwell time, feedback).
  - Constraints: group size 5–10, time/location, budget, safety rules.
  - Objectives: maximize predicted satisfaction/NPS, balance novelty with comfort, ensure inclusion.
  - Explainability: concise, user-readable reasons for matches.
- Safety and trust
  - Real identity verification, community guidelines, report/ban pipeline, host escalation protocols.
  - Venue safety checks and accessibility standards.
- Monetization
  - Per-event ticketing + monthly subscription tier for exclusive events, priority matching, and limited “skip/boost” credits.
- UX tone
  - Warm, inclusive, low-pressure; emphasizes belonging and psychological safety.
- Accessibility
  - Mobile-first, screen-reader friendly, clear language, flexible scheduling, dietary and mobility accommodations.
- Privacy
  - Clear consent for data use; private vibe tags; opt-outs for sensitive categories.

Success metrics
- Event NPS and average satisfaction score
- Match quality rating and repeat connection rate
- Attendance rate vs. RSVP; churn and subscription conversion
- Host-reported group cohesion and incident rate (aim for near-zero)
- Diversity and inclusion measures without compromising safety

Technical notes for implementation
- Questionnaire design: mix of Likert scales and forced-choice tradeoffs to reduce bias; keep to 3–5 minutes.
- Embeddings: transform questionnaire + behavioral data into a vector space; use hybrid scoring (similarity + complementarity + constraints).
- Group formation: solve as a constrained clustering/assignment problem; run daily batch and on-demand updates.
- Cold start: default to broad-interest, low-stakes events with strong hosts; progressively specialize as data accumulates.
- Feedback ingestion: lightweight post-event prompts; weight host feedback higher for group dynamics.
- Explainability: generate short, human-readable rationales per match.
