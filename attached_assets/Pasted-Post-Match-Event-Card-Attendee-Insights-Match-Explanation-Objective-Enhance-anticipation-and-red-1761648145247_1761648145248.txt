Post-Match Event Card: Attendee Insights & Match Explanation
Objective: Enhance anticipation and reduce no-shows by providing compelling previews of table dynamics and the matching rationale.

Implementation: Display this section on the confirmed event card after matching is complete (T-24h).

A. "Meet Your Table" Preview
A curated glimpse into fellow attendees, designed to build curiosity while strictly respecting privacy settings.

Content & Layout:

Format: Horizontal scrollable cards or a compact grid.

Per-Attendee Card Includes:

Name (name_display)

Archetype (e.g., The Explorer, The Storyteller)

Top Interest(s) (1-2 icons or tags from their interests_ranked_top3)

Optional Context: Age Band and/or Industry, only if the user has allowed this visibility in their privacy settings.

Design Principle:

Visual & Snackable: Use icons for interests and archetypes to create a quick, visually engaging scan.

Privacy-First: Contextual details like age and industry are dynamically included based on each individual's privacy toggles (age_visibility, work_visibility). If hidden, the card elegantly omits this line.
